        <br>
        <p>Hello, I'm Marie. Thank you for coming by!<p>
        <p>I'm learning html and css through building this website. In my day job, I build interactive dashboards and support the growth of the Solutions Story Tracker at a fab nonprofit called Solutions Journalism Network.</p>
        <p>I grew up in Anchorage, Alaska, and have had the great fortune to travel to ~30 countries so far. I studied anthropology in undergrad and international affairs in grad school, and I love exploring and learning about cultures and environments around the world.</p>
        <p>Past adventures include writing about market-driven solutions to poverty at Mercy Corps, researching gender topics in conflict-affected countries at UN Women, and coordinating volunteers at Thin Air Community Radio in Spokane, Washington.</p>
